Two potential mobile projects:
All communication between potential and all volunteers and organizations occurs offline. We want to make this communication more streamlined and available through a Women on Call mobile application. The idea is to create a mobile app, using an AirBnB model of communication, for volunteers and organizations to easily converse via text or email. 
The other idea is to create a mobile app that allow people to search for volunteers within a specific location. Similar to other geolocation search applications, one could find volunteers within a certain zip code or perimeter and see results on a map.
